<h2 class="bio-heading">Hi!</h2>

<div class="bio">
  <p>
    I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for web technologies.
    I'm a believer in collaboration, unit testing, and convention over configuration.
  </p>

  <p>
    My initial exposure to HTML/CSS was through a website called <a href="http://www.neopets.com">Neopets</a>.
    I combined the two to create basic designs for my profile for myself and friends, which were mostly rip-offs of the "CSS Wizards" on the website.
    I didn't write another line of code until my freshman year in college.
    Python was my first taste of an actual programming language - and I got hooked.
    I took more CS classes and eventually majored in it.
    Since then, I've dabbled in many other languages and technologies; my goal is to always be learning.

    These days you can find me at Sony Pictures working as a software engineer on a pretty cool digital asset management system.
